19307203,https://www.freelancer.co.uk/projects/articles/essay-words-19307203/,essay 2000 words,"Case Study – Product Design failure in SAMSUNG
Product - Galaxy Note 7
Company: Samsung
Year introduced: 2016
What it was: Tablet phone

Samsung, which had overtaken Apple in the smartphone market once, also had one of the larger and optional more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a South West  Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the error in product design, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market.

Search for research articles, industry reports, company reports and trade publications to answer the following question in this case. Each question has 5 marks. Answer to each question should not be less than one page (500 words).

Question:
Evaluate the Samsung’s approach to new product design
State the importance of product design and its strategic impact for Samsung
Suggest the steps to develop a product design at Samsung
Suggest how Samsung might improve its success rate for future products

Your answer must be based on real research work and focused on product design.
