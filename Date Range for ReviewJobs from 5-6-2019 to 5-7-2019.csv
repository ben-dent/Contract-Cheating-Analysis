19028113,https://www.freelancer.co.uk/projects/business-analysis/Write-business-plan-19028113/,Write up a business plan.,"My name is Ahmed and I am a 32 year old from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and I wish to use my passion for playing retro games to provide a location for others like myself to hang out with friends, playing classics such as Donkey Kong and Mortal Kombat, while consuming on beverages and snacks.  

The business that I have in mind is opening a retro themed arcade and video game cafe or similar in Riyadh. The inspiration behind the idea was when I visited a number of arcade themed bars, or as they classify as ""Barcades"", while travelling across a number of cities around the world. The concept of a ""Barcade"" revolves around a typical alcohol serving bar which contains many classic arcade machines, such as Street Fighter 2 and NBA Jam, and classic video game consoles hooked up to old school CRT TVs such as Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis,  available for their customers to play while enjoying a drink with friends. Very commonly the model of such a place would involve the consumer paying a one time cover fee, which gives him access to play on the machines and consoles for free for the entirety of the stay, only paying additionally for drinks and snacks. Some places use somewhat different models though.  

The business I have in mind is very similar to what is described above, except due to local laws and regulations here in Saudi Arabia, alcohol is considered illegal, therefore it must be replaced with some other form of offering in order to generate revenue and compensate in the place of alcohol. 

What I would like to have is a business plan done. It should cover as many aspects as possible including products, services,  strategic and market analysis, marketing plan, budgeting, a financial plan, sales forecast, etc. I intend on using this information when pitching the idea to potential partners for this business.","Business Analysis, Business Plans, Business Writing, Financial Analysis",13,$555.31,$588,USD,10 days,$588,Saudi Arabia,United States,16/08/19,3 months ago,01/05/19 - 31/05/19,1,,,

19336261,https://www.freelancer.co.uk/projects/research-writing/Research-removal-Performance-Rating/,Research on removal of Performance Rating Systems in Global Companies,"Dear Freelancers,

I require a freelancer to carry out research on companies that have recently removed their performance rating systems from their annual employee performance review process. 

Note: This does not necessarily mean removal of the performance review process – only removal of the quantifiable performance ratings (e.g., Rating from 1-5) given to individuals.
Note II: It is pivotal that companies that maintain a ‘shadow rating system’ in the background should NOT be included in the research (e.g., they have removed ratings from the perspective of the employee but HR still operate and run an ‘undercover’ rating system).

In principle, this project is split into the following 3 phases:

1) The Freelancer must collect market intelligence from 10 companies around the globe (preferably in the Financial Industry Sector)- please use only well-known brands! 

2) The Freelancer must collect market intelligence from 10 public papers (e.g., white papers, news articles, research reports dissertations etc...) on the challenges/ advantages of removing performance rating systems. 

3) Once collected, the Freelancer must summarize the key findings into a 5 page (A4- size 14) document (.docx) each-  5 pages on point 1) and 5 pages on point 2).  

Finally, the successful freelancer should have experience in the field of Human Resources (ideally Performance Management). When you respond, please mention your experience in this respect. 

Whilst, I have a defined budget for this project, I will provide a bonus on top of it, for the selected freelancer if my expectations have been exceeded!  ;o)","Article Rewriting, Human Resources, Report Writing, Research, Research Writing",19,$134.16,$120,USD,3 days,$120,United Arab Emirates,Kenya,20/08/19,3 months ago,01/05/19 - 31/05/19,5,,,
